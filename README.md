Reddit Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes Reddit text data to understand the overall sentiment of posts. It was built to practice Python programming, text processing, and basic Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system processes raw text and classifies content as positive, negative, or neutral.

📌 Project Overview

The project takes Reddit text as input, cleans and preprocesses the data, applies sentiment analysis using VADER, and generates visual insights. It helped me improve my understanding of NLP concepts and real-world text data handling.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NLTK (VADER Sentiment Analyzer)

Matplotlib

CSS (for basic styling)
